# SWL Training Leaderboard

Welcome to the **SWL Training Game Board**! This interactive leaderboard app is designed to display the rankings of various teams in a fun, board game-inspired style. Using Streamlit, we have created a dynamic game board that mimics the vibe of classic tabletop games like **Monopoly** and **Catan**.

## Features

- **Leaderboard**: Shows team rankings, points, and trophies.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, you can install the required packages using `pip`:

## Running the App
To launch the leaderboard app, simply run the following command in your terminal:

- **streamlit run leaderboard_app.py

## Customization
You can easily customize the leaderboard by modifying the following sections in the code:

Data: Change the values in the data dictionary to reflect your teams and their scores.
Design: The gameboard style is controlled via the CSS section. Feel free to tweak the colors, fonts, or layout to suit your style.
