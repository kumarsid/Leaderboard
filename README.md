# SWL Training Leaderboard

Welcome to the **SWL Training Game Board**! This interactive leaderboard app is designed to display the rankings of various teams in a fun, board game-inspired style. Using Streamlit, we have created a dynamic game board that mimics the vibe of classic tabletop games like **Monopoly** and **Catan**.
